    "  * The most common measures of central tendency are the **mean**, **median** and **mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **mean** of a dataset is what is known as the arithmetic average of a dataset. It is calculated from the sum all of the numbers divided by the number of elements in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **median** of a dataset is the middle element. It is calculated from listing the data numerically and selecting the middle element. For even-length datasets, the average of the 2 center elements is the median of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **mode** of a dataset is the most frequently occurring element. The mode can be used for either numeric or categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Categorical Mode](Images/catagorical_mode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* With Python, there are a number of ways to measure the central tendency of the data. However, for this class we will be looking at the NumPy and SciPy packages and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We will use the NumPy package to test for `mean` and `median` and use the SciPy package to test for `mode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The reason we need to use both NumPy and SciPy modules to calculate the measures of central tendency is that mode is not a function in NumPy. This is likely because NumPy is a very lightweight module and calculating the mode can be computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pandas also provides functions to measure central tendency, but students will need to look at the documentation on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The reason we would want to plot new data as soon as possible is to identify key characteristics about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Key characteristics can include if the data is normally distributed, if the data is multimodal, or if there are clusters in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data is considered normally distributed when measurements are obtained independent of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Another characteristic of normally distributed data is that its distribution follows a characteristic bell-curve shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Variance** is the measurement of how far each number in the dataset is away from the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Standard deviation** is the square root of the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * When calculating the variance and standard deviation in Python, we will use the NumPy module.\n",

    "* This first dataset contains National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration temperature measurements taken at the Los Angeles International (LAX) airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To calculate the mean, NumPy provides a decimal with far too much precision. Therefore we should always round the output of `numpy.mean`. In most cases, rounding the mean to the nearest hundredth decimal is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To calculate the median, NumPy also can provide a decimal with far too much precision. However, with this dataset, the median was already rounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * To calculate the mode, the `scipy.stats` module returns 2 arrays, one for all mode values, another for the frequency of each mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The easiest way to assert if a dataset has multiple modes, clusters of values, or if the dataset is normally distributed, is to plot the data using Matplotlib.\n",

    "\n",
    "* There only appears to be one mode in the dataset. Furthermore, the distribution of temperatures around the mode seems to form a bell curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This bell-curve characteristic is known in statistics as a **normal distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The theory behind a **normal distribution** is outside of the scope of this lesson, but it is important to know whether your data is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many statistical tests assume that the data is normally distributed. Using such statistical tests when the data is _not_ normally distributed can cause us to draw incorrect conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The `stats.normaltest` function offers a more quantitative verification of normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * When we used `stats.normaltest` in our example code, we also used the Pandas `DataFrame.sample` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Because `stats.normaltest` function assumes a relatively small sample size, we could not run the test on our entire temperature data. Therefore, we must test on a subset of randomly selected values using Pandas's `DataFrame.sample` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We interpret the results of `stats.normaltest` using the **p** value. A **p** value 0.05 or larger indicates normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Because our **p** value is approximately 0.05 or greater, we can conclude that this distribution is normal.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * **Quantiles** are a way to divide our data into well-defined regions based on their order in a ranked list. The 2 most common quantiles used are **quartiles** and **percentiles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Quartiles** divide the sorted data into 4 equal-sized groups and the median is known as the second quartile.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * An **outlier** is an extreme value in a dataset that can skew a dataset. An **outlier** is typically identified as a value that is 1.5 * IQR (**interquartile range**) beyond the first and third quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * We can visually identify quartiles and outliers using a box and whisker plot. Alternatively, we can identify quartiles using the `1.5 * IQR` rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * When datasets are too large to identify the outliers visually, or when analysis requires more quantitative measures, we should calculate the interquartile range manually using Python modules.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * The data points that are located beyond the whiskers in the plot are potential outliers.\n",

    "  * Often in data analysis we will ask the question \"Is there any relationship between Factor A and Factor B?\" This concept is known in statistics as **correlation**.\n",

    "  ![This is an ideal positive correlation.](Images/corr_ideal_pos.png)\n",

    "  * This is an example of a **positive correlation**. When two factors are positively correlated, they move in the same direction.\n",

    "  * When the factor on the x-axis increases, the factor on the y-axis increases as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![This is an ideal negative correlation.](Images/corr_ideal_neg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This is an example of a **negative correlation**. When two factors are negatively correlated, they move in opposite directions.\n",

    "\n",
    "  ![This is no correlation.](Images/corr_none.png)\n",

    "  * This is an example of two factors with **no correlation**. When two factors are not correlated, their values are completely independent between one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With real-world data, it can be difficult to determine if two factors are correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In statistics we can calculate the degree of correlation using the **Pearson correlation coefficient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The Pearson correlation coefficient is a quantitative measure that describes simultaneous movement (variability) of two factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The correlation coefficient, which is often indicated with the letter *r**, will always fall between –1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Generate a scatter plot with Matplotlib using the year as the independent (*x*) variable and the violent crime rate as the dependent (*y*) variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `stats.linregress` to perform a linear regression with the year as the independent variable (*x*) and the violent crime rate as the dependent variable (*y*).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the information returned by `stats.linregress` to create the equation of a line from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the predicted violent crime rate of the linear model using the year as the *x* values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plot the linear model of year versus violent crime rate on top of your scatter plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Hint**: Your scatter plot and line plot share the same axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Hint**: In order to overlay plots in a notebook, the plots must be in the same code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Repeat the process of generating a scatter plot, calculating the linear regression model, and plotting the regression line over the scatter plot for the following pairs of variables:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Year versus aggravated assault.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `pyplot.subplots` from Matplotlib to create a new figure that displays all three pairs of variables on the same plot. For each pair of variables, there should be a scatter plot and a regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Hint**: All three plots share the same x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the regression lines you created to predict what the violent crime rate, murder rate, and assault rate will be in 20*.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Recall that `stats.linregress` returns a slope, called *m*,, and a *y*-intercept, called *b*. These let you define a line for each fit by simply writing: `y-values = m * x-values + b`, for each linear regression you perform.\n",
